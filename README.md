# Health Insurance Premium Predictor ðŸ’»

## Overview
This project predicts health insurance premiums based on various customer attributes such as age, BMI, region, and more. Using advanced machine learning techniques, the model provides accurate predictions to help users estimate their insurance premiums.

The project includes:
- A cleaned and processed dataset.
- Two predictive models tailored for different age groups:
  - For users aged **â‰¤ 25**, a **Linear Regression model** was trained with an additional feature called **Genetical Risk**.
  - For users aged **> 25**, an **XGBoost model** was employed for its superior performance on larger datasets.
- A user-friendly Streamlit application for interacting with the model.
